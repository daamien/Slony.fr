Slony-I 2.0.0 Released

<P> See the "news" area for more details, including a copy of the release
notes.

<P> This is a <i>major</i> new release of Slony-I; it makes use of
some features introduced in PostgreSQL 8.3, and hence is not
compatible with versions older than 8.3.

<P> This is considered a pretty good tradeoff, as various
functionality would not be possible with earlier versions of
PostgreSQL.
<ul>
<li> Internal catalogues are no longer "hacked with," so that you may, with the new version, use pg_dump against subscribers and be able to expect to have a complete and consistent dump.
<li> Trigger handling is <i>enormously</i> cleaner.
</ul>

<P> Unfortunately, it needs to be noted that there is not, as of yet,
an upgrade procedure to upgrade an installation of Slony-I 1.2.x to
2.0.  At present, upgrading to 2.0 will essentially require dropping
out replication and recreating it.

<P> We hope to have an answer as to how to deal with this in the new year.

<P> Follow <a href=

more details on this.

Checking Cluster State

<p> People frequently ask for assistance in figuring out what might be
wrong with their cluster.  The <em>first thing</em> that you should do
if you think there <em>might</em> be a problem (or even if you don't)
is to run the <a href=
"http://slony.info/documentation/monitoring.html#TESTSLONYSTATE"> test
state </a> scripts.  That may help point you to where the problem is;
it may also help point other would-be helpers to where the problem is.

<p> If you're not running these scripts hourly against your
cluster(s), you really should be...

Slony-I and PostgreSQL 8.1
#
          <p>There is a known incompatibility of versions earlier
          than 1.1.5 with version 8.1; you can expect to see the
          following error message when compiling:</p>
          <em>
slony1_funcs.c:1081: error: too many arguments to function
`Async_Unlisten' 
</em>

          <p>A patch for both version 1.1 "STABLE" and CVS HEAD has
          been committed to CVS; look at both CVS HEAD as well as
          <tt>REL_1_1_STABLE</tt>. It is in the 1.1.5 release
          candidate described above.</p>

Upgrading Slony-I
#
          <p>Beginning with version 1.0.5 the slon replication
          engine refuses to work against any database that does not
          have the stored procedures for the same version loaded or
          where the shared object containing the C language support
          functions and the log trigger does not match the version
          number.</p>

          <p>This means that the Slony installation on all nodes in
          a cluster must be upgraded at once.</p>

          <p>The proper upgrade procedure is this:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Stop the slon replication engine on all nodes.</li>

            <li>Install the new Slony version on all nodes.</li>

            <li>Execute a slonik script containing the command
              <pre>

    update functions (id = );
</pre>for every node in the cluster.
            </li>

            <li>Start all slon replication engines.</li>
          </ol>

Libpq requirements
#
          <p>The multithreaded replication engine requires the
          libpq client library to be compiled with
          --enable-thread-safety on certain operating systems.
          Known are thus far Solaris and AIX. Other operating
          systems are known to not require this (Linux-X86,
          FreeBSD-X86, FreeBSD-Alpha, OpenBSD-Sparc64 and OSX). The
          configuration script is broken with respect to the
          --enable-thread-safety switch for Solaris. Please apply
          this patch, configure and recompile libpq: <a href=
          "http://developer.postgresql.org/%7Ewieck/slony1/download/threadsafe-libpq-742.diff.gz">
